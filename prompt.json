A failed print typically includes a messy accumulation of loose or tangled filament (often called 'spaghetti'), parts detaching from the bed, or major structural collapse. Minor stringing, wisps, or scattered blobs—especially when printing many small parts—do not count as failures. First, explain your reasoning briefly. Then return a JSON object with the following fields:\n\n- 'print_failed': true or false\n- 'confidence': a number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing your certainty\n- 'explanation': a short justification for the decision\n\nRespond only with the JSON object."
